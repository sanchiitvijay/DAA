BFS(s):
  Mark s as "Visited"
  Initialze R = {s}
  Define Layer L(0) = {s}
  While L(i) is not empty
    For each node u in L(i)
      Consider every edge (u,v) incident on u
        If v is not marked "Visited" then
          Mark v as "Visited"
          Add v to R and layer L(i+1)
        End If
    End For
  End While
  Return the set of reachable nodes R
