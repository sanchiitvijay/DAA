Prims():
  Consider an arbitrary node 's' as source
  Initialize MST = {}
  Declare V = {s}
  While all nodes are not in V
    Select a node 'u' which is not in V but has an edge 'e' into V such that value of that edge is Minimum
    Add node 'u' to V
    Add the edge 'e' into MST
  End While
  return MST
